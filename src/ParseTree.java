/**
 * A skeleton class to represent parse trees. The arity is not fixed: a node can
 * have 0, 1 or more children. Trees are represented in the following way: Tree
 * :== Symbol * List(Tree) In other words, trees are defined recursively: A tree
 * is a root (with a label of type Symbol) and a list of trees children. Thus, a
 * leave is simply a tree with no children (its list of children is empty). This
 * class can also be seen as representing the Node of a tree, in which case a
 * tree is simply represented as its root.
